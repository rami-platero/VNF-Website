        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p className='description'>VIP NCS Fans is an NCS fan community and shares things about NCS that only some of the OG fans have known over the years. The idea of this website is to share/show the collection that has been built and it's still being build by the community over the years, containing some of the greatest secrets or fun facts about the record label, and showing those who haven't been here for too long, all the data that has been recovered so far, like backgrounds used for videos, deleted songs/releases from every platform (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc...), artists that produced those songs that are deleted now, and more... The idea is to make this website bigger and bigger so it becomes a way for fans to interect with other fans through the media.</p>
        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p>VIP NCS Fans started as a discord community back in 2017, it was created by fans</p>
